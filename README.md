# FaceRecognition
Python program for the detection of facial features.

This program utilises the InceptionV3 model, with some fine tuning, that has the ability to detect facial features on a set of data. 
The example in this code shows how the model can correctly identify whether the face in the image is 'male or female' 
however, any of the 53 attributes could be used to determine other cosmetic identifiers, such as hair style, age or clothing (glasses or hat).
